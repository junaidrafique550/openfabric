{"message": "Prompt expanded: <think>\nOkay, so I need to interpret and expand the prompt \"A futuristic city with space ships soar-ing between neon skyscrapers.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the main elements are a futuristic city, space ships, and neon skyscrapers. The action is these ships soaring between the skyscrapers.\n\nI should think about how each part can be expanded. Maybe consider different aspects of each element to make the image more vivid or layered.\n\nStarting with the futuristic city: what makes it futuristic? It could have advanced technology, green energy, hover vehicles, smart cities with AR enabled, etc. Neon skies suggest lighting effects, so maybe glow-in-the-dark signs or vibrant LED displays.\n\nNeon skyscrapers: they should be bright and glowing. Maybe each building has unique features, like multiple elevators glowing or neon letters on facades. The city could have a mix of low and high buildings to create depth.\n\nSpace ships: think about how these are depicted. Are they flying through the sky? Or perhaps docked at the skyscrapers? They should have futuristic designs\u2014maybe sleek, transparent with advanced tech like plasma cores or plasma screens showing digital holograms.\n\nThe action of space ships \"soaring\" implies movement and speed. Maybe include a trail effect to show their flight path. Also, considering different times of day could add layers: maybe in the morning when it's light, in the evening for a glow effect, or at night with stars visible.\n\nLighting is crucial\u2014how does the prompt suggest this? Neon colors like neon blue, green, or red can set a futuristic tone. Maybe include highlights on the ships and skyscrapers to make them stand out.\n\nConsidering weather could add realism: maybe hazy skies for a smoggy futuristic feel, or clear skies with stars for an evening glow.\n\nThe prompt also mentions \"soaring,\" which is about movement. Adding wind effects could enhance the scene\u2014like how buildings sway in the wind but the spaceships are moving faster.\n\nThe composition should be dynamic and visually engaging. Maybe include reflections if there's a waterway nearby, giving a sense of depth and interaction with the environment.\n\nI should also think about color schemes. Neon colors can create bright contrasts against darker backgrounds or other elements. Maybe using vibrant hues for the neon lights and cooler tones for the skyscrapers.\n\nIncluding movement in the background could add dynamism to the scene\u2014like cars moving on roads, people walking through pedestrian zones, or even drones flying around.\n\nAlso, considering cultural elements might help make the image more relatable. For example, if it's a city with a unique vibe like neon art districts blending with high-tech areas.\n\nIn terms of depth and layers, maybe have some elements receding into the background to give a sense of space in the scene, even though the ships are flying towards the viewer.\n\nFinally, the prompt seems open-ended. I can suggest adding more details or enhancing certain aspects based on interpretation.\n</think>\n\n**A Futuristic City with Orbiting Ships and Neon Skyscrapers: A Visual Exploration**\n\n**1. Futuristic City Details:**\n- **Technology Integration:** The city features advanced tech like vertical gardens, smart traffic systems, and green energy sources such as solar and wind turbines.\n- **Hover Vehicles:** Include floating cars and drones for a dynamic scene with people moving through the air.\n\n**2. Neon Skyscrapers:**\n- **Glowing Structures:** Each building has unique neon accents\u2014glowing signs on facades and elevators, creating vibrant LED displays that change with time or context.\n- **Variety in Design:** Skyscrapers come in different heights and styles, adding depth to the cityscape.\n\n**3. Orbital Ships:**\n- **Aesthetic Design:** Sleek, transparent ships with plasma cores or screens displaying digital holograms, blending into the futuristic environment.\n- **Movement and Trail Effects:** Showcase the ships' speed with a trailing light effect, enhancing their flight path visualization.\n\n**4. Lighting and Color Scheme:**\n- **Neon Colors:** Use bright hues like neon blue, green, and red to set a futuristic tone.\n- **Lighting Effects:** Highlight ship surfaces and skyscraper edges for contrast and visual impact.\n\n**5. Weather and Background:**\n- **Atmospheric Conditions:** Consider hazy skies for a smoggy look or star-filled evenings for an evening glow effect.\n\n**6. Environmental Interactions:**\n- **Reflections and Depth:** Include reflections on nearby waterways and use depth to create a dynamic scene with receding elements in the background.\n\n**7. Movement and Composition:**\n- **Diverse Scenery:** Add moving cars, pedestrians, and drones to enhance movement dynamics.\n- **Cultural Elements:** Incorporate unique city vibes with neon art districts blending into high-tech zones.\n\n**8. Depth and Layers:**\n- **Visual Hierarchy:** Use layers of elements receding into the background for a sense of depth in motion.\n\nThis approach creates a vivid, dynamic scene that captures the essence of a futuristic city with orbiting ships and neon skyscrapers, inviting imagination and engagement.\nImage and 3D model generated successfully."}
